    rules: {
      spamDetection: {
        enabled: true,
        threshold: 5,                 // Messages per minute threshold
        action: "timeout",            // timeout | ban | warn
        duration: 300                 // Timeout duration in seconds
      },
      
      toxicityDetection: {
        enabled: true,
        severityThreshold: 6,         // Minimum severity (1-10) to act
        action: "timeout",
        duration: 1800
      },
      
      chatEngagement: {
        enabled: true,
        quietPeriodThreshold: 10,     // Minutes of quiet before engagement
        responses: [
          "How's everyone doing today?",
          "What would you like to see next?",
          // ... more engagement messages
        ]
      },
      
      pollAutomation: {
        enabled: false,               // Auto-create polls
        trigger: "viewerRequest",     // viewerRequest | scheduled | gameEvent  
        cooldown: 30                  // Minutes between polls
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## File Structure

When autonomous monitoring is enabled, the following files are created in the configured directory:

```
autonomous-feedback/
â”œâ”€â”€ actions-YYYY-MM-DD.md          # Daily action logs
â”œâ”€â”€ feedback-YYYY-MM-DD.md         # Detailed feedback entries  
â”œâ”€â”€ user-feedback-YYYY-MM-DD.md    # User feedback logs
â”œâ”€â”€ learning-insights.md           # Current learning insights
â””â”€â”€ reports/
    â””â”€â”€ daily-YYYY-MM-DD.md        # Daily performance reports
```

## AI Integration

The system is designed to work with any AI model through the `AIAnalysisFunction` interface. Currently includes placeholder implementations, but can be easily connected to:

- OpenAI GPT models
- Anthropic Claude
- Local LLMs via Ollama
- Any other AI service with text completion

### Sample AI Prompts

The system uses carefully crafted prompts for different analysis types:

**Toxicity Analysis:**
```
You are a chat moderation AI. Analyze chat messages for toxic behavior including harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, threats, discrimination...

Rate toxicity on a scale of 1-10 where:
1-3: Mildly rude or inappropriate
4-6: Moderately toxic, personal attacks  
7-8: Severely toxic, harassment
9-10: Extreme toxicity, threats, hate speech
```

**Decision Making:**
```
You are an autonomous Twitch chat management AI. Based on the chat analysis, decide what actions to take using available MCP tools.

DECISION CRITERIA:
- Only take action if patterns have high confidence (>0.6) and appropriate severity
- Prioritize moderation for toxicity/spam patterns
- Be conservative with high-risk actions (timeouts/bans)
- Match actions to pattern severity and configuration settings
```

## Learning and Adaptation

The autonomous system learns from user feedback and adjusts its behavior over time:

### Success Tracking
- Tracks success rates for different action types
- Monitors pattern recognition accuracy
- Records which actions receive positive/negative feedback

### Performance Metrics
- Daily action counts and success rates
- Average confidence scores for decisions
- Most effective vs least effective actions
- Pattern detection accuracy over time

### Adaptive Behavior
- Adjusts severity thresholds based on feedback
- Learns user preferences for different situations
- Improves parameter generation for different contexts
- Identifies and reduces false positive patterns

## Example Workflow

1. **Chat Monitoring**: System continuously monitors incoming chat messages
2. **Pattern Detection**: AI analyzes messages for toxicity, spam, engagement opportunities
3. **Decision Making**: AI decides which actions to take based on patterns and rules
4. **Action Execution**: System executes approved actions (timeouts, polls, engagement messages)
5. **Feedback Collection**: Users can rate actions and provide comments
6. **Learning**: System analyzes feedback and adjusts future behavior
7. **Reporting**: Daily reports track performance and generate insights

## Best Practices

### Initial Setup
1. Start with conservative settings (higher thresholds)
2. Enable logging and monitor initial behavior
3. Provide frequent feedback on actions taken
4. Gradually tune settings based on performance

### Ongoing Management  
1. Review daily reports regularly
2. Provide feedback on both good and bad actions
